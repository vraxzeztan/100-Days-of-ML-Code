## Day 1 - 11 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress** - Worked on implementing gradient descent and a Neural Network w/o any hidden layer

**Thoughts** - Will try and work on implementing Neural Network with a hidden layer


## Day 2 - 12 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress** - Tried to implement a Neural Network with a hidden layer , also looked into TensorFlow. Finally completed Neural Network implementation.

**Thoughts** - Have to some college work besides this :/

## Day 3 - 13 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress** - Worked on MNIST dataset using tensorflow

**Thoughts** - Next up keras and CNNs.

## Day 4 - 14 Aug 2018

**Today's Progress** - Read about CNNs and Keras

**Thoughts** - Will work on MNIST data using CNN by keras

## Day 5 - 15 August 2018

**Today's Progress** - Implemented CNN on MNIST data using Keras, Worked on RNNs and also read about Unsupervised Learning.

**Thoughts** - Happy Independence Day 

## Day 6 - 16 August 2018

**Today's Progress** - Implemented CNN and SVM classifier on cifar-10 dataset

**Thoughts** - CNNs are really powerful and easy to use with Keras

## Day 7 - 17 August 2018

**Today's Progress** - Read about RNNs

## Day 8 - 18 August 2018

**Today's Progress** - Started work on OpenCV library

## Day 9 - 19 August 2018

**Today's Progress** - Learned about handling images as data in numpy arrays. Worked on some previous projects of Regression.

## Day 10 - 20 August 2018

**Today's Progress** - Text Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes
